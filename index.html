                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I'm Vidhyashree, a passionate and professional web developer building amazing websites. I specialize
                in
                front-end development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build responsive and user-friendly web
                pages. I
                also have experience in back-end development, using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase to create
                dynamic
                and secure web applications. I love learning new technologies and exploring new challenges in web
                development.
                Some of the projects that I have worked on include:
                - A e-commerce website that allows users to browse, search, and buy products online. I used React for
                the
                front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database
                - A social media website that connects users with similar interests and hobbies. I used Firebase for the
                authentication, storage, and hosting, and React for the front-end.

                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always eager to learn new skills and improve my existing ones. I am currently learning Python and
                Django to
                expand my web development knowledge. I am also interested in web design and UI/UX, and I use tools like
                Adobe
                Photoshop and Figma to create mockups and prototypes for my projects.

                I am looking for new opportunities to work with clients who share my passion for web development and
                innovation.
                If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me through my email or phone
                number.
                You
                can also check out my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles to see more of my work and achievements. Thank you
                for
                visiting my portfolio website and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
